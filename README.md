# odin-recipes

## What is this project for? 

This is my first project following [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com)'s curriculum. I will make a recipe website.

## What skills will be demonstrated in this project?

I will demonstrate my ability to use various *simple* HTML elements, including:

* Headings
* Ordered & unordered lists
* Images
* Paragraphs
* Bold and italics
* Line breaks
* Much more...

I have also learnt some simple **Markdown** to make this README more visually appealing.
